def analyze_cosmic_data(data):
    # Perform data analysis and processing using advanced AI techniques
    
    # Extract relevant information such as celestial object properties, spectral data, and spatial coordinates
    celestial_properties = data['properties']
    spectral_data = data['spectra']
    spatial_coordinates = data['coordinates']
    
    # Perform analysis on celestial properties
    celestial_summary = summarize_celestial_properties(celestial_properties)
    
    # Perform analysis on spectral data
    spectral_summary = summarize_spectral_data(spectral_data)
    
    # Perform analysis on spatial coordinates
    spatial_summary = summarize_spatial_coordinates(spatial_coordinates)
    
    # Generate markdown output
    output = f"# Cosmic Data Analysis\n\n"
    output += f"## Celestial Object Properties\n\n"
    output += f"{celestial_summary}\n\n"
    output += f"## Spectral Data\n\n"
    output += f"{spectral_summary}\n\n"
    output += f"## Spatial Coordinates\n\n"
    output += f"{spatial_summary}\n\n"
    
    return output

def summarize_celestial_properties(properties):
    # Perform analysis on celestial object properties
    summary = ""
    # Add code to analyze and summarize celestial object properties
    return summary

def summarize_spectral_data(spectra):
    # Perform analysis on spectral data
    summary = ""
    # Add code to analyze and summarize spectral data
    return summary

def summarize_spatial_coordinates(coordinates):
    # Perform analysis on spatial coordinates
    summary = ""
    # Add code to analyze and summarize spatial coordinates
    return summary

# Example usage
data = {
    'properties': {
        'object_type': 'star',
        'magnitude': 5.2,
        'distance': 1000.0
    },
    'spectra': {
        'wavelength': [400, 500, 600, 700],
        'intensity': [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2]
    },
    'coordinates': {
        'ra': 12.345,
        'dec': -45.678
    }
}

output = analyze_cosmic_data(data)
print(output)
```

The above code defines a function `analyze_cosmic_data` that takes in a dictionary `data` containing cosmic data obtained from telescopes and satellites. It performs analysis and processing using advanced AI techniques to extract relevant information such as celestial object properties, spectral data, and spatial coordinates.

The `summarize_celestial_properties`, `summarize_spectral_data`, and `summarize_spatial_coordinates` functions are placeholders where you can add code to perform specific analysis on each type of data.

The code generates a markdown output that provides a summary of the analyzed data along with any significant findings or patterns. The output is formatted using markdown syntax for easy readability.

You can customize the `data` dictionary with your own cosmic data or use the provided example data for testing.

To implement a data visualization module for cosmic data, you can use Python and libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. Here's an example of how you can generate interactive and informative plots and graphs based on the processed cosmic data:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Scatter plot
def generate_scatter_plot(x, y, title, x_label, y_label):
    plt.scatter(x, y)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel(x_label)
    plt.ylabel(y_label)
    plt.show()

# Heatmap
def generate_heatmap(data, title):
    sns.heatmap(data)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()

# 3D representation
def generate_3d_plot(x, y, z, title):
    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter3d(x=x, y=y, z=z, mode='markers')])
    fig.update_layout(title=title)
    fig.show()

# Example usage
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
z = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

generate_scatter_plot(x, y, "Scatter Plot", "X", "Y")
generate_heatmap(data, "Heatmap")
generate_3d_plot(x, y, z, "3D Plot")
```

You can customize the functions and plots according to your specific requirements and the data you have processed. These functions will generate the plots and graphs, and you can include the generated visualizations in your reports or presentations by saving them as images or embedding them using appropriate markdown syntax.

## Automated Cosmic Data Collection

To automate the process of data collection from multiple sources, including telescopes, satellites, and astronomical databases, we can develop a Python script using advanced AI techniques. This script will retrieve the latest cosmic data, filter it based on user-defined criteria, and store it in a structured format for further analysis.

### Prerequisites

To develop a machine learning model that can predict the properties and behavior of celestial objects based on the analyzed cosmic data, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1. Preparing the Data:
   - Ensure that the analyzed cosmic data is in a structured format, with relevant features and corresponding labels.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as data normalization or scaling.
   - Extract relevant features from the cosmic data that are likely to influence the properties and behavior of celestial objects.

3. Building the Machine Learning Model:
   - Import the required libraries, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task, such as a decision tree, random forest, or neural network.
   - Define the architecture of the model, including the number and type of layers, activation functions, and regularization techniques.
   - Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

4. Training the Model:
   - Fit the model to the training data using the `fit` function, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.
   - Monitor the training process to ensure the model is learning and making progress.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

5. Fine-tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization:
   - Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to improve performance.
   - Use techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to identify the optimal hyperparameters.

6. Saving and Loading the Model:
   - Save the trained model to disk using the appropriate library functions, such as `save_model` in scikit-learn or `save_weights` in TensorFlow.
   - Provide instructions on how to load the saved model for future predictions.

Below is an example code snippet demonstrating the steps outlined above:

```python
# Step 1: Preparing the Data

# Load the preprocessed cosmic data and split it into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering

# Perform any necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, scaling)

# Step 3: Building the Machine Learning Model

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Define the model architecture
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 4: Training the Model

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Step 5: Fine-tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization

# Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters

# Step 6: Saving and Loading the Model

# Save the trained model to disk
model.save('celestial_object_model.h5')

# Load the saved model for future predictions
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('celestial_object_model.h5')
```

Please note that the above code is just an example, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the structure of your cosmic data.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Download necessary resources
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Function to preprocess text
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize text into sentences
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    
    # Initialize Lemmatizer
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    
    # Preprocess each sentence
    preprocessed_sentences = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Tokenize sentence into words
        words = word_tokenize(sentence)
        
        # Remove stopwords and punctuation
        filtered_words = [word.lower() for word in words if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english') and word.isalnum()]
        
        # Lemmatize words
        lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_words]
        
        # Join words back into sentence
        preprocessed_sentence = ' '.join(lemmatized_words)
        preprocessed_sentences.append(preprocessed_sentence)
    
    # Join preprocessed sentences back into text
    preprocessed_text = ' '.join(preprocessed_sentences)
    
    return preprocessed_text

# Function to extract information from text using NLP
def extract_information(text, query):
    # Preprocess text
    preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text)
    
    # Tokenize query
    query_tokens = word_tokenize(query.lower())
    
    # Initialize results list
    results = []
    
    # Search for query tokens in preprocessed text
    for token in query_tokens:
        if token in preprocessed_text:
            results.append(token)
    
    return results

# Example usage
text = "Scientific paper or article text goes here."
query = "What are the properties of celestial objects mentioned in the text?"

# Extract information from text using NLP
information = extract_information(text, query)

# Print extracted information
print(information)
```

Instructions:

1. Ensure that you have NLTK library installed. You can install it using `pip install nltk`.
2. Download the necessary resources by running the following commands:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```
3. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.
4. Replace the placeholder `"Scientific paper or article text goes here."` with the actual text you want to analyze.
5. Modify the `query` variable to match your specific question about the properties of celestial objects mentioned in the text.
6. Run the code.
7. The extracted information will be printed as a list of relevant terms.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

def anomaly_detection(data):
    # Perform anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
    clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(data)

    # Predict anomalies in the data
    anomalies = clf.predict(data)

    # Return indices of anomalous data points
    anomalous_indices = np.where(anomalies == -1)[0]

    return anomalous_indices

# Example usage
data = np.array([[1.2, 3.4, 5.6],
                 [2.3, 4.5, 6.7],
                 [10.1, 12.3, 14.5],
                 [100.2, 200.4, 300.6]])

anomalous_indices = anomaly_detection(data)
print("Anomalous indices:", anomalous_indices)
```

To apply the anomaly detection algorithm to cosmic data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your cosmic data in a structured format, such as a numpy array or a pandas DataFrame. Ensure that the data contains relevant features or properties that can be used for anomaly detection.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.

3. Modify the `data` variable to contain your cosmic data. Each row of the array should represent a data point, and each column should correspond to a feature or property.

4. Adjust the `contamination` parameter in the `IsolationForest` constructor if needed. This parameter determines the expected proportion of anomalies in the data. The default value of 0.05 assumes that only 5% of the data is anomalous.

5. Run the code. The algorithm will detect and return the indices of the anomalous data points in the `anomalous_indices` variable.

6. Analyze the anomalous data points to identify unusual patterns or events in the cosmic data that may indicate the presence of rare celestial phenomena or unexpected behaviors.

Note: The anomaly detection algorithm used in this code is the Isolation Forest algorithm. You may explore other anomaly detection algorithms depending on the specific requirements of your cosmic data analysis.
